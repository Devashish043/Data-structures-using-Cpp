# 🧠 Advanced Data Structures Library in C++

A powerful, flexible, and reusable C++ implementation of classic and advanced data structures—tailored for performance, extensibility, and educational insight.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project contains custom-built implementations of various **Data Structures** along with a wide array of functionalities. Built with a focus on clean design, performance, and reusability through **template functions**, this library allows operations on not only primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, etc.) but also user-defined classes.

## 🔧 Features & Functionalities

### 🌳 AVL Tree
- Insertion (Push)
- Deletion (Pop)
- Check if Node Exists
- Inorder Traversal
- Preorder Traversal
- Postorder Traversal
- Auto-balancing after insertion/deletion

### 🌲 Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Insert Node
- Get/Search Node
- Find Max Element
- Find Min Element
- Construct BST from Sorted Array/Vector
- Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversal
- Zigzag Traversal
- Vertical Traversal

### 📦 Stack
- Push
- Pop
- Peek
- IsEmpty

### ⚖️ Balanced Symbols Checker
- Supports: `()`, `{}`, `[]`
- Real-time stream-based input
- Determines if symbol stream is balanced

### ⏫ Priority Queue
#### Min Heap / Max Heap
- Insert Element (Push)
- Remove Root Element (Pop)
- Get Min/Max Element
- Supports generic data types using templates

### 🔗 Graph
- **Sparse Graph**: Implemented using Adjacency List
- **Dense Graph**: Implemented using Adjacency Matrix
- Flexible design to support both undirected and directed graphs

## 💡 Template Programming Support

All major data structures in this repository are designed using **C++ templates**, enabling:
- Reusability with custom data types
- Type safety and generic design

```cpp
